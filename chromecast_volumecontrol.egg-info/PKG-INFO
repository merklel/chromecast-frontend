Description: ### GUI for Chromecast Volumecontrol
        
        ![frontend image](chromecast_volumecontrol/img/gui.png)
        
        Control the volume of your chromecasts through this little gui on your computer of choice, not through the awful google home app. Based on top of the awesome [pychromecast](https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast) lib.
        
        App listens to changes of volume through other apps (e.g. google home) and adjusts sliders.
        
        Tested with chromecast audios only, i do not have others.
        
        ## Run it
        Clone and run gui.py, not yet more available, still under development. Dependencies are python3 and pychromecast.
        
        ## Future
        Add REST interface for IOT devices controlling the volume via hardware sliders. They could communicate with
        some endpoint. Currently, flask_endpoint.py is used to allow for some testing e.g. using arduinos with wifi.
